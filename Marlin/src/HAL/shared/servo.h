/**
 * A servo is activated by creating an instance of the Servo class passing the desired pin to the attach() method.
 * The servos are pulsed in the background using the value most recently written using the write() method
 *
 * Note that analogWrite of PWM on pins associated with the timer are disabled when the first servo is attached.
 * Timers are seized as needed in groups of 12 servos - 24 servos use two timers, 48 servos will use four.
 * The sequence used to seize timers is defined in timers.h
 *
 * The methods are:
 *
 *  Servo - Class for manipulating servo motors connected to Arduino pins.
 *
 *  attach(pin )  - Attaches a servo motor to an i/o pin.
 *  attach(pin, min, max  ) - Attaches to a pin setting min and max values in microseconds
 *  default min is 544, max is 2400
 *
 *  write()     - Sets the servo angle in degrees.  (invalid angle that is valid as pulse in microseconds is treated as microseconds)
 *  writeMicroseconds() - Sets the servo pulse width in microseconds
 *  read()      - Gets the last written servo pulse width as an angle between 0 and 180.
 *  readMicroseconds() - Gets the last written servo pulse width in microseconds.
 *  attached()  - Returns true if there is a servo attached.
 *  detach()    - Stops an attached servos from pulsing its i/o pin.
 *  move(angle) - Sequence of attach(0), write(angle),
 *                   With DEACTIVATE_SERVOS_AFTER_MOVE wait SERVO_DELAY and detach.
